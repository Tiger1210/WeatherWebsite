# WeatherWebsite

I created a simple Weather Website called PerfectWeather using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. This website allows you to enter the name of a city and see the weather of that particular city. It also allows you to see the date and time in which you are accessing the weather. All the weather information were fetched from the publicly available OpenWeatherMap API. Note that I have intentionally removed my API key and if you want to use this program, you will need to create an account on OpenWeatherMap to get a free API key.
