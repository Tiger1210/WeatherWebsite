# WeatherWebsite

This is a simple weather app created with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. All the weather information were fetched from the publicly available OpenWeatherMap API. Note that I have intentionally removed my API key and if you want to use this program, you will need to create an account on OpenWeatherMap to get a free API key.
